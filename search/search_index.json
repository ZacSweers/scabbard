Your browser does not support the video tag. More advanced examples . Features \u00b6 Visualize entry points, dependency graph, component relationships and scopes in your Dagger 2 setup. Minimal setup - Scabbard's Gradle plugin prepares your project for graph generation and provides ability to customize graph generation behavior. IDE integration - Easily view a @Component or a @Subcomponnet graph directly from source code via gutter icons (IntelliJ/Android Studio). Supports both Kotlin and Java. Getting Started \u00b6 Requirements \u00b6 GraphViz \u00b6 Scabbard uses GraphViz to generate graphs and hence requires dot command to be available for it to work. Installation instructions \u00b6 Mac - Install via homebrew. brew install graphviz . Linux - Install via apt. sudo apt-get install graphviz . Windows - Install via GraphViz installer After installation, verify installation by executing dot -V , example: dot - graphviz version 2.38.0 (20140413.2041) Installation \u00b6 Repositories \u00b6 Scabbard artifacts are served via jcenter() . Please ensure jcenter() is added to your root build.gradle . Gradle Plugin \u00b6 Using the plugins DSL: plugins { // After Java, Kotlin or Android plugins id \"scabbard.gradle\" version \"0.0.1\" } or if you are using older versions of Gradle: buildscript { repositories { maven { url \"https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/\" } } dependencies { classpath \"gradle.plugin.dev.arunkumar:scabbard-gradle-plugin:0.0.1\" } } // After Java, Kotlin or Android plugins apply plugin: \"scabbard.gradle\" After applying the plugin, configure the plugin by adding a scabbard block: scabbard { enabled = true } Success That's it. Now after building the project, Scabbard would have generated dot and png files for your Dagger components in your build folder. Android Studio/Idea Plugin \u00b6 Scabbard also ships an IDE plugin to open generated png's directly from your source code via gutter icons. Please install plugins from File > Preferences/Settings > Plugins > Market Place > Search for \"Scabbard\" > Install and Restart. Alternatively you could download the plugin jar file directly from releases and install via File > Preferences/Settings > Plugins > Gear Icon > Install from Disk and point to jar file . Success That's it. The plugin will automatically add an icon \ud83d\udde1 next to @Component , @Subcomponent or @Module as soon as project is indexed. Other build systems \u00b6 Scabbard at its core is just an annotation processor. You could add dev.arunkumar:scabbard-processor:0.0.1 to your build system's annotation processor config to get it working.

Please search Github Issues . Does it support mixed Kotlin/Java projects? \u00b6 Yes. What is the impact on binary size? \u00b6 There should be no impact since Scabbard only runs during compilation and generated images are not meant to be packaged into binary. You could control if Scabbard is enabled for release builds via scabbard { enabled = false } block. What is the impact on build time? \u00b6 Scabbard processor uses standard annotation processing APIs to generate images. This lets the processor be cacheable and does not run when inputs have not changed. Currently there are no benchmark available and more work is expected to be done in performance area. Scabbard processor is a plugin to Dagger via Dagger SPI and it is non incremental. There are some ideas to workaround this, please see #. How can I understand the generated graph? \u00b6 Please refer to Scabbard cheat sheet. Will more formats (svg) be supported? \u00b6 Yes, there are plans to support more formats. Please \ud83d\udc4d this issue. I don't see gutter icons to view graph. \u00b6 Please wait for Android Studio/IntelliJ indexing to be done for gutter icons to be visible. Even after indexing if the icons are not visible, please file an issue. You could also look for generated png file in the build folder. Some dependencies are missing. \u00b6 In order to keep graphs small and readable, Scabbard groups the dependencies by @Component or @Subcomponent and renders them in individual graphs. This has the benefit of keeping the graphs readable for large projects but this structure might not properly render cross component dependencies (inherited bindings in a subcomponent). Some work is being doing in this area, please refer #. Any other format for visualizing the dependency graph? \u00b6 Some other graph formats being considered are: Component Tree : Render component and subcomponents in a tree structure similar to Uber Ribs. Single graph : Instead of splitting the graph into multiple files, render all nodes in single file.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#frequently-asked-questions","text":"Have a question that isn't part of the FAQ?
